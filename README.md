# Less Mixes for YouTube

This extension stops YouTube from automatically turning music videos into Mix playlists.  
Instead of forcing every video, single, or OST into an auto-generated playlist, it lets you watch only the video you clicked — no mixes with random songs added. You don’t need to worry about autoplay anymore; this extension works whether autoplay is on or off.

## Configurable Options

- **Keep Music Videos as Videos** – Prevents YouTube from turning music videos into Mix playlists.  
- **Turn Mixes into Single Videos** – Plays only the displayed video instead of starting the Mix playlist.  
- **Turn My Mix into Single Video** – Plays only the selected video instead of starting “My Mix.”  

## How It Works

- Clears unnecessary URL parameters like `&list=` and `&start_radio=1`  
- Redirects you to the clean URL so only the selected video plays  

## Installation
